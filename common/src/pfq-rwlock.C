// This file contains a simplified implementation of a spin-based shared lock.

//
// Notes:
//   the reference uses a queue for arriving readers. on a cache coherent
//   machine, the local spinning property for waiting readers can be achieved
//   by simply using a cacheable flag. the implementation here uses that
//   simplification.
